Machine learning (ML) continues to grow in importance for many organizations across nearly all domains. Some example applications of machine learning in practice include:

* Predicting the likelihood of a patient returning to the hospital (_readmission_) within 30 days of discharge.
* Segmenting customers based on common attributes or purchasing behavior for targeted marketing.
* Predicting coupon redemption rates for a given marketing campaign.
* Predicting customer churn so an organization can perform preventative intervention.
* And many more!

In essence, these tasks all seek to learn from data.  To address each scenario, we can use a given set of _features_ to train an algorithm and extract insights. These algorithms, or _learners_, can be classified according to the amount and type of supervision needed during training.  

# Learning objectives

This module will introduce you to some fundamental concepts around ML and this class. By the end of this module you will:

1. Be able to explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
2. Know when a problem is considered a regression or classification problem.
3. Understand the objective and structure of this course and the type of exercises involved.
4. Be able to import and explore the data sets we'll use through various examples.

# Supervised learning

A ___predictive model___ is used for tasks that involve the prediction of a given output (or target) using other variables (or features) in the data set. The learning algorithm in a predictive model attempts to discover and model the relationships among the <font color="red">target</font> variable (the variable being predicted) and the other <font color="blue">features</font> (aka predictor variables). Examples of predictive modeling include:

* using <font color="blue">customer attributes</font> to predict the probability of the <font color="red">customer churning</font> in the next 6 weeks;
* using <font color="blue">home attributes</font> to predict the <font color="red">sales price</font>;
* using <font color="blue">employee attributes</font> to predict the likelihood of <font color="red">attrition</font>;
* using <font color="blue">patient attributes</font> and symptoms to predict the risk of <font color="red">readmission</font>;
* using <font color="blue">production attributes</font> to predict <font color="red">time to market</font>.

Each of these examples has a defined learning task; they each intend to use attributes ($X$) to predict an outcome measurement ($Y$).

```{block, type='note'}
Throughout this course we'll use various terms interchangeably for

* $X$: "predictor variable", "independent variable", "attribute", "feature", "predictor"
* $Y$: "target variable", "dependent variable", "response", "outcome measurement"
```

The predictive modeling examples above describe what is known as _supervised learning_.  The supervision refers to the fact that the target values provide a supervisory role, which indicates to the learner the task it needs to learn. Specifically, given a set of data, the learning algorithm attempts to optimize a function (the algorithmic steps) to find the combination of feature values that results in a predicted value that is as close to the actual target output as possible.

```{block, type='note'}
In supervised learning, the training data you feed the algorithm includes the target values.  Consequently, the solutions can be used to help _supervise_ the training process to find the optimal algorithm parameters.
```

Most supervised learning problems can be bucketed into one of two categories, _regression_ or _classification_, which we discuss next.

## Regression problems

When the objective of our supervised learning is to predict a numeric outcome, we refer to this as a ___regression problem___ (not to be confused with linear regression modeling).  Regression problems revolve around predicting output that falls on a continuum. In the examples above, predicting home sales prices and time to market reflect a regression problem because the output is numeric and continuous.  This means, given the combination of predictor values, the response value could fall anywhere along some continuous spectrum (e.g., the predicted sales price of a particular home could be between \$80,000 and \$755,000).  The figure below illustrates average home sales prices as a function of two home features: year built and total square footage. Depending on the combination of these two features, the expected home sales price could fall anywhere along a plane.

```{r intro-regression-problem, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig 1: Average home sales price as a function of year built and total square footage."}
library(plotly)
df <- AmesHousing::make_ames()
x <- matrix(sort(df$Gr_Liv_Area)[floor(seq(1, nrow(df), length.out = 15))], 15, 1)
y <- matrix(sort(df$Year_Built)[floor(seq(1, nrow(df), length.out = 15))], 1, 15)
z <- 25051 + 3505*(log(x^.9) %*% log(y)) - 5*as.vector(x) 
c <- matrix(c(.92, .95, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, .95), 1, 15)
z <- sweep(z, MARGIN = 2, c, `*`)
plot_ly(x = as.vector(x), y = as.vector(y), z = z, showscale = FALSE) %>%  
    add_surface() %>%
    layout(
        scene = list(
            xaxis = list(title = "Feature: square footage"),
            yaxis = list(title = "Feature: year built"),
            zaxis = list(title = "Response: sale price")
        )
    )
# code for 3D print version
# par(mar = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1))  # remove extra white space
# persp(
#   x = x,
#   y = y,
#   z = z,
#   xlab = "Square footage",
#   ylab = "Year built",
#   zlab = "Sale price",
#   theta = -45,
#   phi = 25,
#   col = viridis::viridis(100)
# )
```


## Classification problems

When the objective of our supervised learning is to predict a categorical outcome, we refer to this as a ___classification problem___.  Classification problems most commonly revolve around predicting a binary or multinomial response measure such as:

* Did a customer redeem a coupon (coded as yes/no or 1/0)?
* Did a customer churn (coded as yes/no or 1/0)?
* Did a customer click on our online ad (coded as yes/no or 1/0)?
* Classifying customer reviews:
    * Binary: positive vs. negative.
    * Multinomial: extremely negative to extremely positive on a 0--5 Likert scale.
    
```{r classification-problem, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.cap="Fig 2: Classification problem modeling 'Yes'/'No' response based on three features.", cache=FALSE}
## code to create graphic
library(DiagrammeR)
grViz("

  digraph boxes_and_circles {
    node [shape = circle]
    x1; x2; x3;

    node [shape = box]
    Model;

    node [shape = triangle]
    Yes; No;

    x1->Model; x2->Model; x3->Model; Model->No; Model->Yes;
}")
```

However, when we apply machine learning models for classification problems, rather than predict a particular class (i.e., "yes" or "no"), we often want to predict the _probability_ of a particular class (i.e., yes: 0.65, no: 0.35).  By default, the class with the highest predicted probability becomes the predicted class.  Consequently, even though we are performing a classification problem, we are still predicting a numeric output (probability).  However, the essence of the problem still makes it a classification problem.

Although there are machine learning algorithms that can be applied to regression problems but not classification and vice versa, most of the supervised learning algorithms we cover in this module can be applied to both.  These algorithms have become the most popular machine learning applications in recent years. 


# Unsupervised learning

___Unsupervised learning___, in contrast to supervised learning, includes a set of statistical tools to better understand and describe your data, but performs the analysis without a target variable.  In essence, unsupervised learning is concerned with identifying groups in a data set. The groups may be defined by the rows (i.e., *clustering*) or the columns (i.e., *dimension reduction*); however, the motive in each case is quite different.

The goal of ___clustering___ is to segment observations into similar groups based on the observed variables; for example, to divide consumers into different homogeneous groups, a process known as market segmentation.  In __dimension reduction__, we are often concerned with reducing the number of variables in a data set. For example, classical linear regression models break down in the presence of highly correlated features.  Some dimension reduction techniques can be used to reduce the feature set to a potentially smaller set of uncorrelated variables. Such a reduced feature set is often used as input to downstream supervised learning models (e.g., principal component regression).

Unsupervised learning is often performed as part of an exploratory data analysis (EDA). However, the exercise tends to be more subjective, and there is no simple goal for the analysis, such as prediction of a response. Furthermore, it can be hard to assess the quality of results obtained from unsupervised learning methods. The reason for this is simple. If we fit a predictive model using a supervised learning technique (i.e., linear regression), then it is possible to check our work by seeing how well our model predicts the response _Y_ on observations not used in fitting the model. However, in unsupervised learning, there is no way to check our work because we don’t know the true answer---the problem is unsupervised!  

Despite its subjectivity, the importance of unsupervised learning should not be overlooked and such techniques are often used in organizations to: 

- Divide consumers into different homogeneous groups so that tailored marketing strategies can be developed and deployed for each segment.
- Identify groups of online shoppers with similar browsing and purchase histories, as well as items that are of particular interest to the shoppers within each group. Then an individual shopper can be preferentially shown the items in which he or she is particularly likely to be interested, based on the purchase histories of similar shoppers.
- Identify products that have similar purchasing behavior so that managers can manage them as product groups.

These questions, and many more, can be addressed with unsupervised learning.  Moreover, the outputs of unsupervised learning models can be used as inputs to downstream supervised learning models.


# Objective

The goal of this course is to provide effective tools for uncovering relevant and useful patterns in your data by using the R and Python ML ecosystems with a ***focus on supervised learning***. The progression of this course is designed around 4 themes:

- **Lessons** to teach you how the sub-tasks of ML fit together.
- **Code recipes** to illustrate how to apply ML tasks and workflows with R & Python.
- **Exercises** to get your applying what you learned and deeping your understanding.
- **Portfolio builders** to force you to bring together your knowledge and create end-to-end solutions.

## Lessons

The lessons are designed to help you understand the individual sub-tasks of an ML project. The focus is to have an intuitive understanding of each discrete sub-task. Once you understand when, where, and why these sub-tasks are performed you will be able to transfer this knowledge to other projects. The concepts you will learn include:

1. Provide an overview of the ML modeling process:
   - feature engineering
   - data splitting
   - model fitting
   - model validation and tuning 
   - performance measurement

2. Cover common supervised learners:
   - linear regression
   - regularized regression
   - K-nearest neighbors
   - decision trees
   - bagging & random forests
   - gradient boosting

3. Illustrate how to maximize predictive performance with:
   - hyperparameter
   - stacking models

## Code Recipes

To help your understanding we provide code recipes in both R and Python so that you can start implementing these ML sub-tasks in both languages. These recipes will include 

- **Small recipes** that illustrate discrete tasks such as normalizing features or tuning a random forest model.
- **Large recipes** that demonstrate how to put several sub-tasks together for a larger ML workflow. This may include (a) creating a training sample, (b) applying feature engineering sub-tasks, (c) performing a grid search for a k-nearest neighbor model, (d) assessing model performance.

## Exercises

At the end of each module we provide additional exercises for you to perform. These exercises force you to apply your knew knowledge on different data sets. For the exercises we use small well-understood data sets because:

- **They are small**, which means they can easily be ran on your local machine in a reasonable time.
- **They are well behaved**, meaning you often don't need to do a lot of feature engineering to get a good result and there is often a small range of options for good results.
- **They are benchmarks** meaning that many people have used them before and you can get ideas of good approaches to maximize performance.

## Portfolio builders

Newcomers to the world of ML can have a difficult time extrapolating what they have learned and applying the ML process to new, more complex data sets that don't have benchmark examples. The portfolio builder exercises are designed to get you working through this challenge by identifying new data sets and applying the ML process to uncover patterns in the data. Whether patterns, strong or weak, exist is not the most important goal; rather, getting comfortable working through the ML process on new data sets where examples are not prevelant is!

# Python & R {.tabset}

You will always find a debate between which language is "best" for machine learning -- Python or R. Unfortunately this is a poor way to think about ML and these two languages. 

First, your objective should be to understand the fundamental machine learning concepts. Second, you should have a solid understanding of how to apply these concepts in either language because which one you use can largely be driven by the culture of the organization you work for.

Consequently, this course will illustrate how to apply machine learning in both languages. Code recipes will be supplied in Python (`r fontawesome::fa("python")`) ___and___ R (`r fontawesome::fa("r-project")`) tabs as illustrated here:

## `r fontawesome::fa("python")`

[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) is the predominate Python package for machine learning. Unlike R, scikit-learn provides nearly all components required for the modeling process (i.e. sampling, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation). Scikit-learn is part of the SciPy ecosystem, which is a group of Python libraries for mathematics, science and engineering. Other packages that you will commonly use for ML in Python include:

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/): Provides foundational data structures and computations to efficiently work with data arrays.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Provides data visualization capabilities.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Tools and data structures to organize and analyze your data.

The following Python packages are used throughout this module. You may want to use a virtual environment; however, most code recipes should run regardless of small deviations in package versions.

```sh
# data management
pip install -U pandas
pip install -U numpy

# data visualization
pip install -U matplotlib
pip install -U plotnine

# modeling
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

```{python}
import sklearn

sklearn.__version__
```

## `r fontawesome::fa("r-project")`

Historically, the R ecosystem provides a wide variety of ML algorithm implementations. This has its benefits; however, this also drawbacks as it requires the users to learn many different formula interfaces and syntax nuances. More recently, development on a group of packages called [Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) has helped to make implementation easier. 

Whereas in Python you can perform most, if not all, of the ML sub-tasks with scikit-learn, the tidymodels collection allows you to perform discrete parts of the ML workflow with discrete packages:

- [rsample](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/) for data splitting and resampling
- [recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/) for data pre-processing and feature engineering
- [parsnip](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/) for applying algorithms
- [tune](https://tune.tidymodels.org/) for hyperparameter tuning
- [yardstick](https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/) for measuring model performance

The following R packages are used throughout this module. You may want to use a virtual environment; however, most code recipes should run regardless of small deviations in package versions. Note that when you install tidymodels you are actually installing several packages that exist in the tidymodels framework as discussed above.

```r
# common data wrangling and visualization
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("vip")

# modeling
install.packages("tidymodels")
```

```{r, message=TRUE}
packageVersion("tidymodels")

library(tidymodels)
```

# The data sets {#data}

The data sets chosen for this course allow us to illustrate the different features of the presented machine learning algorithms.  Since the goal of this course is to demonstrate how to implement ML workflows, we make the assumption that you have already spent significant time cleaning and getting to know your data via EDA. This would allow you to perform many necessary tasks prior to the ML tasks outlined in this course such as:

* Feature selection (i.e., removing unnecessary variables and retaining only those variables you wish to include in your modeling process).
* Recoding variable names and values so that they are meaningful and more interpretable.
* Recoding, removing, or some other approach to handling missing values.

Consequently, the exemplar data sets we use throughout this book have, for the most part, gone through the necessary cleaning processes. As mentioned above, these data sets are fairly common data sets that provide good benchmarks to compare and illustrate ML workflows. Although some of these data sets are available in R and/or Python, we will import these data sets from a .csv file to ensure commonality regardless of language.

It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
