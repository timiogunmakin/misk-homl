## Setting up your environment

The following packages will be used:

```{r}
list_of_pkgs <- c(
  "AmesHousing",   # provides data we'll use
  "baguette",      # boot strap aggregating
  "naniar",        # visualize missing data
  "pdp",           # model interpretation
  "plsmod",        # partial least squares modeling
  "ranger",        # random forest modeling
  "stacks",        # stacking multiple models in an ensemble
  "tidyverse",     # data munging & visualization
  "tidymodels",    # data modeling tasks
  "vip"            # model interpretation
)
```

Run the following line of code to install the packages you currently do not have:

```{r}
new_pkgs <- list_of_pkgs[!(list_of_pkgs %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if (length(new_pkgs)) install.packages(new_pkgs)
```
